## 🌍 What is OpenWork

**OpenWork** defines a simple, open, and universal method to:

- Offer monetary rewards (bounties) for work on issues, features, bugs, or project contributions.
- Make bounties visible, searchable, and transparent using GitHub-native tools (labels, badges, templates).
- Help developers discover paid work across GitHub with zero barriers.

> **OpenWork** is a reference for requesting collaborative effort GitHub
> enabling individuals, teams, and organizations to fund collaborative work,
> and for developers to find paid opportunities across open projects.
> A place to discuss payment mechanics and expectations, to be all aligned

## 📜 How to use it

1. **Put the badge in your project page**
   - `OpenWork: This project uses OpenWork` 
   - Users post the proof of completion
   - Maintainers 

2. **How is work paid off?**
   - Offer a reward for someone to do some work, respecting the OpenWork guidelines
   - Someone does the work for you and posts proof of its work, either with a picture or submitting an edit to a file. 
   - The worker now shares its payment details with the requester, which pays what's due on acceptance and posts a closure

3. **Add Visual Badges and Labels to Issues (Optional)**
   - 💰 `Bounty: $<amount>` — specifies the bounty amount.
   - 🏷️ `Type: <Bug | Feature | Management | Research>` — describes the type of work.
   - 💸 `Payment: <Method>` — outlines payment method (PayPal, Wire, Crypto, Invoice, Other).
   - ⚡ `Urgency: <Low | Medium | High>` — indicates task priority.
   - Use [Shields.io](https://shields.io) or similar to create bounty badges for higher visibility.

4. **Standardize Issue Templates as much as possible**
   Each bounty issue should clearly state these info with the aim of being more searchable from the top bar:
     - Amount offered
     - Payment method
     - Task description
     - Conditions for acceptance
     - Contact information

5. **Comment and propose changes**
