## 📜 How to use it

1. **Put the badge in your project page**
   - `OpenWork: This project uses OpenWork` 


2. **Add Visual Badges to Issues (Optional)**
   - 💰 `Bounty: $<amount>` — specifies the bounty amount.
   - 🏷️ `Type: <Bug | Feature | Management | Research>` — describes the type of work.
   - 💸 `Payment: <Method>` — outlines payment method (PayPal, Wire, Crypto, Invoice, Other).
   - ⚡ `Urgency: <Low | Medium | High>` — indicates task priority.
   - Use [Shields.io](https://shields.io) or similar to create bounty badges for higher visibility.

3. **Standardize Issue Templates as much as possible**
   Each bounty issue should clearly state these info with the aim of being more searchable from the top bar:
     - Amount offered
     - Payment method
     - Task description
     - Conditions for acceptance
     - Contact information

4. **Comment and propose changes**
